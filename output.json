PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia revealed that nearly 70% of recent storm accidents were caused by poorly installed solar panels many of which were mounted on open roofs or unsecured frames, collapsing during high winds.   The PDMA has issued a formal letter to the Energy Department, Local Government, and all commissioners, emphasizing the need for certified, standard-compliant installations.   The authority has called for thorough inspections of existing panels and urged the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to assess, repair, and ensure installation safety.

    "content": "Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran, which stood at $3 billion, would be taken to $10 billion in the next few years, as there was immense potential for growth.   In an interview with IRNA, prior to his visit to Tehran on Monday, the prime minister said the bilateral trade between the two countries had witnessed a significant increase in the past three to four years.    We want to take it up to $10 billion in the next few years, but I think the potential is much larger than that as well. We are discussing signing a free trade agreement (FTA). I think in the next ten years, the trade volume between the two countries will expand a great deal. The need is to have sustained economic engagements for the long term between Pakistan and Iran,  the Iranian news wire quoted the prime minister as saying.   The prime minister, to a query, replied that he strongly believed that the economic destiny of both countries was interlinked as they shared a border of about 900 kilometers.   No Bargains, Just Better Rides: Yango Launches in Multan with Safer, Affordable Mobility  I personally believe that a strong economic linkage between Pakistan s Balochistan and Iran s Sistan-Baluchestan can be good for the entire region. It can also be very effective in dealing with terrorism,  he added.   He further mentioned that the two countries had signed memoranda of understanding about developing projects between these provinces.   Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif further underscored the need for sustained economic engagement between Iran and Pakistan.   To a question regarding his Iran s visit, the prime minister said that he was undertaking the visit at the invitation of President Masoud Pezeshkian.    The principal objective of my visit is to thank Iran for supporting and standing by us during our conflict with India. India, as you know, imposed war on us, which we repulsed through a decisive but measured and well-calibrated response consistent with international humanitarian law. So, I want to thank the Iranian leadership for its support and its offer for mediation, which we accepted but India rejected,  he added.   Veteran PPP Leader and Former Sindh Governor Kamaluddin Azfar passes away in Karachi He said that during his visit, he would also discuss the bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.   The prime minister also appreciated the excellent bilateral ties between the brotherly countries, adding that Islamabad and Tehran would continue to support each other on issues of the Muslim Ummah and regional cooperation.   Responding to another question, he said that he strongly believed there could be no peace and justice in the region till the resolution of Kashmir and Palestine issues, reiterating that it was critically important that these issues should be resolved in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri and Palestinian people.   About Iran-US talks, the prime minister said they believed that negotiations, diplomacy, and engagement were the best solutions because, in this way, they could avoid conflicts and wars.    It is important to promote peace, development, and security in the region. I have great faith in Iran s leadership. I am quite hopeful that positive things will come out of these negotiations. On behalf of Pakistan, I wish peace and stability prevail in the region,  he added.   PDMA moves to regulate solar panel installations after storm-linked accidents To a question, the prime minister said they were grateful to Iran for its offer of mediation during the recent conflict with India, which showed its sincerity and wisdom, in promoting peace and stability in the region, and thanked President Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Araqchi for their efforts to defuse tensions in South Asia.

    "content": "Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday to discuss the long-delayed Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway (M-6) and other key road projects aimed at improving connectivity in the province.   The meeting was attended by the federal secretary for communications, Chairman of the National Highway Authority (NHA), and other senior officials.   Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah stressed the importance of completing the Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar motorway network, emphasizing that  the motorway s objective could not be fulfilled until the Karachi Port connects with other parts of the country.  He pointed out that while numerous motorway sections have been completed, the critical M-6 link remains pending.   Echoing the CM s concerns, Aleem Khan noted that integrating Karachi Port with the national motorway network is essential for the project's success. He informed the CM that the M-6 project has been divided into five sections, with funding secured for three of them. Construction is already underway in some areas with support from the federal government and partner banks.   No Bargains, Just Better Rides: Yango Launches in Multan with Safer, Affordable Mobility Murad Ali Shah expressed reservations over executing the project under a public-private partnership model, warning that it could lead to further delays. He offered provincial support of Rs 40 to 50 billion through bridge financing to expedite the project.  We want an immediate beginning of the work on M-6,  the CM asserted.   The meeting also reviewed the progress on the Jamshoro-Sehwan road, with Aleem Khan confirming that construction is ongoing and 66 km of the road has already been completed.   M-10 Motorway ProjectDiscussions also covered the proposed new M-10 motorway from Karachi to Hyderabad. The planned route will start from the ICI Bridge (KPT), passing through Gulbai and Hub Chowki to Hyderabad. The project aims to ease congestion and provide a direct route for heavy and port traffic.   Officials agreed on the need for complete planning of the M-10 project to streamline freight movement from Karachi Port to the interior.   Veteran PPP Leader and Former Sindh Governor Kamaluddin Azfar passes away in Karachi Lyari Expressway and Sohrab Goth TrafficThe NHA briefed the meeting on a recent audit that deemed the Lyari Expressway unfit for heavy vehicles. CM Murad Ali Shah suggested enhancing the interchanges and building a service road at Sohrab Goth to separate local and heavy traffic.    The objective of the expressway to divert port traffic to the motorway was not achieved,  the CM said, citing the current convergence of port and local traffic at Sohrab Goth as a major source of congestion.   The meeting concluded with a decision to explore engineering solutions to resolve the persistent traffic jams in the area.  "

    "content": "The Supreme Court emphasized on Monday that judicial consent is mandatory at four distinct stages in the process of transferring judges, reinforcing the principle of judicial independence.   This observation came during the hearing of a constitutional case concerning the legality and framework of judicial transfers, particularly focusing on issues of seniority and the scope of Articles 175 and 200 of the Constitution. The five-member constitutional bench was led by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.   Lawyer Faisal Siddiqi, presenting his arguments, contended that the Islamabad High Court was formed under Article 175, and that existing judicial appointment laws apply only to provincial courts. He argued that transfers to the Islamabad High Court fall outside this scope and, if made, should be temporary without requiring judges to retake their oath upon return.   In response, Justice Mazhar questioned whether Article 200, which relates to the transfer of judges, became obsolete with the introduction of Article 175A. Siddiqi replied that the current transfer practice undermines the Judicial Commission s authority and compromises constitutional integrity.   No Bargains, Just Better Rides: Yango Launches in Multan with Safer, Affordable Mobility Justice Shakeel Ahmed suggested that a unified seniority list for judges across the country could reduce disputes, an idea supported by Siddiqi, who warned that manipulating judicial seniority through executive decisions could be seen as authoritarian.   Justice Mazhar clarified that a judge s transfer involves four key stages of approval by the chief justices of both the sending and receiving high courts, the judge in question, and the chief justice of Pakistan. Without consensus among these parties, a transfer cannot proceed, emphasizing the judiciary s control over the process.   Siddiqi further alleged that the current legal framework had been exploited to bypass judicial authority and manipulate seniority in bad faith.   The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday, when Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is scheduled to present the government s arguments.  "
